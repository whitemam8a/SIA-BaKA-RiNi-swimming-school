All training is supervised by qualified coaches with experience working with children and ensuring comfort and safety in the water. We use modern equipment and maintain the pool's cleanliness at a high standard. For young children, lessons are held in shallow water, and beginner swimmers are supported with floatation devices. Groups are formed based on age and skill level so each child receives proper attention and support. Coaches provide mandatory safety briefings before each session and teach essential water safety skills that are useful not only during lessons but also in real life. With us, your child is in safe hands and will enjoy swimming in a secure and friendly environment."
